# Possible Improvements

While the current implementation of the **Movie Browser** is functional, there are several areas where the application can be enhanced further. Below are some potential improvements:

---


## 1. **Server-Side Favorite Movie Storage**
   - **Current State**: The application stores favorite movies in `localStorage`, which is not synced across devices.
   - **Improvement**: Move favorite movie storage to a server-side database to allow syncing across multiple devices.
   - **Benefits**: Provides users with a consistent experience across different devices and prevents data loss when switching browsers or clearing cache.

## 2. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - **Current State**: The design is functional, but there are opportunities for improvement in user experience.
   - **Improvement**: Refine the UI and improve the overall user experience with:
     - More intuitive navigation
     - Enhanced animations and transitions
   - **Benefits**: Creates a more polished and engaging interface, improving user retention and satisfaction.
